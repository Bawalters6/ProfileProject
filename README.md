# **Portfolio Project** #

## **Discription** ##
This is my Portfolio project for Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree.  My name is Blake Walters and have created a porfolio page using a mock draft given and then customizing it to my own personal portfolio.

## **Usage** ##
To use this webpage, all you need to do is scroll up and down to see the header with my information and the pictures and links in my portfolio for projects. If you click on an image it will bring up a new window with information in it.  If you click the buttons you will be brought to the projects once projects are completed.

### **Additional Information** ###
_This is just my own personal Udacity Portfolio projects, there is no need or want for collaboration on this project, just a portfolio webpage to show some of my future projects._
